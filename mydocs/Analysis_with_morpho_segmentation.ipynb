    "\n",
    "1. Data handling:\n",
    "    - In the **Choose main folder** you should browse to the folder containing your data.\n",
    "    - In the **Saving** folder you should select to which folder you want to export results.\n",
    "    - The **Load Segmentation** button allows to re-load an existing analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Selecting channels in the **Chose segmentation and signal channels (folders or tifs)** section:\n",
    "    - You should choose which channel you want to use for **segmentation** (left)\n",
    "    - and from which channels you want to extract **signal** information (right). If you want to analyze the intensity of the segmentation channel, you have to select it as well as a **signal**.\n",
    "    - Once selection is done you can load the data with the **Initialize** button.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Computing type**: select cluster, if you want computations to be submitted via a SLURMCluster job-queue.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Set segmentation parameters**:\n",
    "    - **Maxtime**: select the last time point to be analyzed, by default the last available time point\n",
    "    - **Step**: If for example you only want to analyze every second step, enter 2.\n",
    "    - **Bad frame**: If you want to skip certain frames, enter them here, e.g. (e.g. 1,2,5-8,12)\n",
    "    - **Segmentation**: Select your segmentation mode (see [this chapter](segmentation.ipynb) for more details)\n",
    "    - **Location X/Y**: Location of the cell to track can be entered here manually.\n",
    "    - **Window depth/width**: Desired dimensions (in px) of the windows.\n",
    "    - Run the segmentation with the **Click to segment** button.\n",
    "    - Save the results with the **Save the segmentation** button.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Plot: The central plot shows an image and its current windowing. One can adjust:\n",
    "    - The **Time** (frame) and the **intensity range** of the current image.\n",
    "    - Whether to **show windows** or **show labels** of windows.\n",
